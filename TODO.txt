COURSE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS
=======================================

HIGH PRIORITY
------------
1. Add error handling and logging
   - Add try/except blocks around critical operations
   - Log recommendation calculations and errors
   - Add proper error messages for users

2. Performance Optimization
   - Cache recommendation results 
   - Add pagination for recommendations (instead of fixed 10)
   - Optimize database queries in get_recommendations()

3. User Experience
   - Add loading indicator while calculating recommendations
   - Allow users to rate/provide feedback on recommendations
   - Add "Why was this recommended?" explanations

MEDIUM PRIORITY
-------------
4. Recommendation Quality
   - Add course difficulty level to recommendation factors
   - Consider user's academic history/grades if available
   - Weight recent user preferences more heavily

5. Testing
   - Add unit tests for recommendation logic
   - Add integration tests for the recommendation flow
   - Test edge cases (no similar users, new users, etc)

LOW PRIORITY
-----------
6. Analytics
   - Track which recommendations users select
   - Monitor recommendation accuracy/relevance
   - Add admin dashboard for recommendation metrics

7. Future AI Improvements
   - Research implementing matrix factorization
   - Consider A/B testing different recommendation algorithms
   - Collect more user interaction data for better recommendations

NOTES
-----
- Current system uses basic collaborative filtering
- Focus on stability and user experience before AI improvements
- Document any algorithm changes for future maintenance 
- Improve the UI/UX of the recommendations page
